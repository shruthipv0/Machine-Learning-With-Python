# Neural Networks

## What is a Neural Network?

- It is a machine learning models that mimic the complex functions of the human brain.
- It consists of interconnected nodes or neurons that process data, learn patterns, and enable tasks such as pattern recognition and decision-making.

### Learning in neural networks follows a structured, three-stage process:

1. Input Computation: Data is fed in.  
2. Output Generation: Output based on given parameters.
3. Iterative Refinement: Output refinement by adjusting weights and biases.
